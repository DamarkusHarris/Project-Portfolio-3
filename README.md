# Project-Portfolio-3
Showcasing School Work (Technical Writing) 

In this Project-Portfolio-3 course I extended my existing projects by applying knowledge of enterprise authentication, 
network security, and risk assessment to create a project of multiple integrated servers that have been secured. 
I demostrated design, installation, configuration, and validation of a properly secured system using shared authentication
and network security rules. At the end of this course I completed a written project plan documenting the system and 
design decisions that were made based on research of risk-management and security best practices. 

Milestone 1 demostrates step-by-step instructions on how to install, setup, and configure Docker and Mayan EDMS. 
Milestone 2 demostrates step-by-step instructions on how to install, setup, and configure Samba: File Server. 
Milestone 3 demostrates step-by-step instructions on how to instlal, setup, and configure the NLB (Network Load Balancing) feature in Microsoft Azure.
Milestone 4 demostrates step-by-step instructions on how to use PowerShell to create a VM and how to install and 
unistall server roles. 

The Final Presentation I was able to choose one of the given topics, in which I chose PCI Data Security Standards and created
a PowerPoint slide of the Topic. 

The Term Paper was research on Industry 4.0. I discussed What is 4.0, the technologies that are transforming industrial production,
CPS or Cyber-Phyical Systems and much more!
